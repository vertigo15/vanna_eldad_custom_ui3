"""Module-level state populated by the FastAPI lifespan.

We deliberately use module globals rather than `app.state` so route handlers
read the same handles the way they did when everything lived in `main.py`.
The lifespan in `src.api.lifespan` is the only place these are mutated.

Routes import the module and call the getter helpers in
`src.api.dependencies`, which raise an HTTPException(503) when the app is
not yet initialised (e.g. during graceful shutdown).
